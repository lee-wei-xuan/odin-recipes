        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna, a renowned Italian dish, is a gastronomic marvel defined by its intricate layers. It begins with wide pasta sheets, cooked till al dente, forming the foundation. Between these sheets, a tantalizing blend of seasoned ground meat, like beef, pork, or sausage, marries with a robust tomato sauce. Velvety béchamel sauce adds a creamy touch, while mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses infuse richness. This layering sequence repeats, crowned with cheese that crisps to gold as the dish bakes. The result is a harmonious melding of pasta, savory meat, sauces, and cheese.</p>
        <p>A global favorite, lasagna's adaptability shines through diverse interpretations—vegetarian versions abound, along with innovative seafood adaptations. Beyond its taste, lasagna symbolizes comfort and celebration. Its enduring allure lies in the interplay of textures and flavors, a culinary tradition cherished across cultures, encapsulating the heart of Italian comfort food.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>ake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
